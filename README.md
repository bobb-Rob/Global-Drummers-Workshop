# Global-Drummers-Workshop

> This project is the Final capstone project of the first module at microverse. It is aimed at building a responsive UI of a website for an event themed "_**Global Drummers Festival 2022**_". 

In this project, I built the home and the about page of the website and it is adaptable to all screen sizes. The template I used as a guide was originally designed by [Cindy Shin in Behance](https://www.behance.net/adagio07).
